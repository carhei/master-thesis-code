## Short Motivation
* Shortcoming of model-based control
* Shortcomings of unsafe learning control
* --> Safe Learning Control
* Applications in Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles...

## Method on the basis of an example
* Autonomous Vehicle
* Complex Model --> apply RL
* Guarantee Safety with HJI
* Update estimate of unmodeled dynamics with GP
* Existing methods do not explore explicitly
* Figure to summarise

## Exploration
* Definition and Advantages
* Incremental Q-Learning

## Results
* with and without exploration

## Conclusions and Future Work
* Nice idea
* Hard to obtain guarantees
* Future directions
